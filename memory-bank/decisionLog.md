  - Updated directoryStructure.md with the new project structure
  - Modified systemPatterns.md to include the new architecture
  - Updated productContext.md to include cloud functions in the technology stack
  - Added the restructuring to activeContext.md and progress.md

## February 26, 2025 - Import Path Fixes After Project Restructuring

**Context:**
After moving the Next.js frontend to a dedicated frontend/ directory, the import paths in the component files were broken. The imports were using `@/frontend/components/...` and `@/frontend/lib/...` paths, but the path alias `@/*` in tsconfig.json pointed to the current directory (frontend), so it should have been just `@/components/...` and `@/lib/...`.

**Decision:**
Fix all import paths in the component files to use the correct path aliases.

**Rationale:**
- Incorrect import paths were causing build errors and preventing the application from running
- The path alias `@/*` in tsconfig.json was correctly configured to point to the current directory (frontend)
- Consistent import paths improve code maintainability and readability
- Automated approach ensures all files are updated correctly

**Implementation:**
- Created a script (fix-imports.js) to automate the process of fixing import paths
- The script scanned all TypeScript files in the components directory
- Updated all import paths from `@/frontend/lib/...` to `@/lib/...`
- Updated all import paths from `@/frontend/components/...` to `@/components/...`
- Verified the fix by running the development server and confirming the website works correctly

## February 26, 2025 - Google Cloud Run Configuration with Database for Form Submissions

**Context:**
The project needs to be configured to run on Google Cloud Run with a database for storing form submissions. The functions directory is intended for serverless cloud functions, with a specific need for a form submission function.
