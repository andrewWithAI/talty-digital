# Talty Digital LLC Website - Decision Log

This document tracks key architectural and design decisions made throughout the project lifecycle, including context, rationale, and implementation details.

## February 26, 2025 - Technology Stack Selection

**Context:**
The project requires a modern, scalable, and maintainable technology stack that supports server-side rendering, dynamic routing, and component-based architecture.

**Decision:**
Adopt Next.js (React-based) for the frontend with ShadCN UI components and Google Cloud Platform for hosting.

**Rationale:**
- Next.js provides server-side rendering capabilities, improving SEO and initial load performance
- React ecosystem offers a wide range of libraries and community support
- ShadCN components provide accessible, customizable UI elements that accelerate development
- Google Cloud Platform offers scalability, reliability, and a comprehensive suite of services

**Implementation:**
- Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript support
- Integrate ShadCN component library
- Set up Tailwind CSS for styling
- Configure Google Cloud Platform for deployment (specific services to be determined)

## February 26, 2025 - Memory Bank Initialization

**Context:**
The project needs a structured way to maintain context, track decisions, and document progress.

**Decision:**
Implement a Memory Bank system with core files for tracking different aspects of the project.

**Rationale:**
- Centralized documentation improves project visibility and knowledge sharing
- Structured approach ensures consistent documentation of decisions and progress
- Separate files for different concerns makes information easier to find and update

**Implementation:**
- Create memory-bank directory with core files:
  - productContext.md: Project overview and goals
  - activeContext.md: Current session focus and open questions
  - progress.md: Work completed and next steps
  - decisionLog.md: This file - decisions and rationale
  - systemPatterns.md: Architectural patterns and standards

## February 26, 2025 - Homepage Architecture with Frosted Glass Navbar

**Context:**
The homepage needs to be designed with a frosted glass effect on the navbar and a consistent color scheme throughout the design.

**Decision:**
Implement a component-based architecture for the homepage with a frosted glass navbar using Tailwind CSS backdrop filters.

**Rationale:**
- Frosted glass effect creates a modern, sophisticated aesthetic that aligns with the brand identity
- Component-based architecture improves maintainability and reusability
- Using Tailwind CSS for styling ensures consistency and efficiency
- The established color scheme reinforces brand identity across the site

**Implementation:**
- Create atomic design components (atoms, molecules, organisms) for the homepage
- Implement frosted glass effect using backdrop-filter and semi-transparent backgrounds
- Apply the color scheme consistently across all components
- Structure the homepage with distinct sections: hero, services overview, about, contact form, and footer
- Ensure responsive design for all viewport sizes

## February 26, 2025 - Component Library Implementation

**Context:**
The project requires a consistent and reusable component library to maintain design coherence and development efficiency.

**Decision:**
Implement a component library following atomic design principles with TypeScript for type safety.

**Rationale:**
- Atomic design provides a clear methodology for organizing components
- TypeScript ensures type safety and improves developer experience
- Reusable components reduce duplication and improve maintainability
- Consistent styling across components enhances user experience

**Implementation:**
- Created component directory structure with atoms, molecules, organisms, and templates
- Implemented core atom components (Typography, Button, Input, Icon, Logo)
- Built molecule components (NavItem, FormField, ServiceCard, SocialLinks)
- Developed organism components (Navbar, HeroSection, ServicesOverview, ContactForm, Footer)
- Used TypeScript interfaces for component props
- Applied consistent styling using Tailwind CSS utility classes

## February 26, 2025 - Frosted Glass Navbar Implementation

**Context:**
The navbar needs to have a frosted glass effect that is visually appealing and functional across different devices.

**Decision:**
Implement the frosted glass effect using Tailwind CSS backdrop-filter and a semi-transparent background.

**Rationale:**
- Backdrop-filter provides a modern, elegant blur effect
- Semi-transparent background ensures text remains readable
- The effect works well with the color scheme
- The implementation is performant and works across modern browsers

**Implementation:**
- Used `backdrop-blur-md` Tailwind class for the blur effect
- Applied semi-transparent background colors using opacity modifiers
- Added a subtle border for better visual separation
- Implemented scroll detection to add shadow when scrolled
- Ensured responsive behavior with mobile menu toggle
- Maintained accessibility with proper contrast and keyboard navigation

## February 26, 2025 - Animations and Transitions Implementation

**Context:**
The website needs animations and transitions to enhance user experience and create a more engaging and polished interface.

**Decision:**
Implement a comprehensive animation system using Framer Motion library with reusable animation components and utilities.

**Rationale:**
- Animations and transitions improve user engagement and perceived performance
- Framer Motion provides a powerful and flexible API for creating animations in React
- Reusable animation components ensure consistency across the site
- Proper animation timing and easing create a more professional feel
- Animations can guide users' attention and improve usability

**Implementation:**
- Created an animations utility library with reusable animation variants
- Implemented animated versions of key components:
  - AnimatedSection for scroll-triggered animations
  - AnimatedButton for interactive button animations
  - AnimatedServiceCard for hover effects on cards
- Enhanced the navbar with scroll effects and mobile menu animations
- Added staggered animations for lists and grids to create visual hierarchy
- Implemented subtle hover animations for interactive elements
- Ensured animations are accessible by respecting user preferences (prefers-reduced-motion)
- Optimized animations for performance by using hardware acceleration where appropriate

## February 26, 2025 - Navbar Color Scheme Adjustment

**Context:**
The navbar's light color scheme was too contrasting with the rest of the page, which uses a darker color palette. This created a visual disconnect between the navbar and the content.

**Decision:**
Update the navbar color scheme to use darker colors that match the rest of the page, specifically using the night and gunmetal colors from our color palette.

**Rationale:**
- Visual consistency between the navbar and content creates a more cohesive design
- Darker colors align better with the overall brand identity and color scheme
- Improved contrast between text and background enhances readability
- The frosted glass effect is more subtle and elegant with a darker background

**Implementation:**
- Changed the navbar background to use rgba(0, 15, 8, 0.5) (night-500 with opacity)
- Updated the scrolled state to use a slightly darker background rgba(0, 15, 8, 0.7)
- Modified text colors to use mint_cream-500 for better contrast against the dark background
- Updated dropdown menus to use the night-400 color for consistency
- Adjusted the Logo component to use light colors against the dark navbar
- Ensured all interactive elements maintain proper contrast ratios for accessibility
